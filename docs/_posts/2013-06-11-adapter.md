## Example Info:

Back in the 60s there were tons of Astronatus working for NASA. At the
time, all they needed to learn was how to fly NASA's ships. When ever NASA
came out with a new ship, it was similar to the olds ones. This worked for
decades. All was well in the galaxy.

However in 2010, NASA shut down the Space Shuttle program. The Astronauts
were out of jobs and started to look for new ones. Once the Astronauts realized
that their space suits made for poor work attire on Earth, they knew they had to
revist the stars. So they went to the next best company to work for, SpaceX.
When they got to SpaceX they realized that technology had changed quite a bit
since the 60s. SpaceX realized this as well, so to compensate for the Astronauts
they came up with an idea to use the Adapter pattern.

The smart SpaceX engineers made a new class that just 'Adapted' the old
interface of the NASA Space Shuttles to SpaceX's new rocket ships. The
Astronauts now had no problem flying SpaceX's ships through the galaxy.

Together the Astronauts and SpaceX were able to settle the galaxy far
and wide with SpaceX's reusable rockets.
